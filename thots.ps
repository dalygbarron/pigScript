call 2 "readInt" n         ;read in a value for n
move n i                   ;i = n


;loop where the maths occurs
label loopStart
  sub i one i              ;i -= 1
  add n i n                ;n += i
  jgt loopStart i          ;repeat if i > 0


;output the results
call 2 "writeString" "final value is "
call 2 "writeInt" n
call 1 "writeNL"
