# pigScript
A scripting language, compiler and virtual machine that can be used in games and stuff.

## What this entails
You will create an instance of the VM, and then you will register functions with it that
may have any number of arguments, you also provide the name it will be known under inside
the script. You will have to check that the arguments are correct inside the function, and
if they aren't there will be some kind of error thing that you can send to the vm which
will then say which line has an error and that it is a wrong arguments error yeee.
